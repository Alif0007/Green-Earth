#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
 var is the old way of making variables—it works everywhere in a function. let is the newer way, it stays only in the block where you wrote it, and you can change its value. const is like let, but once you set a value, it can’t be changed.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
When I want to go through a list, forEach() just  run something for every item. map() goes through the list too, but it also gives  back a brand-new list with the changed items. filter() gives  a new list too, but only with the items that match a rule  set.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Arrow functions are just a shorter, cleaner way to write functions. They look nicer, use fewer words, and are easy to read.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Destructuring is a shortcut to take values from an object or array and put them directly into variables. It saves time and keeps the code neat.

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Template literals are special strings written with backticks. They let  easily put variables right inside the sentence without using +. It makes writing messages or combining text much smoother.
